# ⚙️ Automatic Safe Events

Safe Events are preventing cheaters to trigger events to server from a cheating software.

### How can I install it on my server?

You just need to include in your resources manifest file (`fxmanifest.lua / __resource.lua` ) the following lines of code:

```lua
client_script '@ac-resource-name/extern/events_cl.lua'
server_script '@ac-resource-name/extern/events_sv.lua'
```

And voila! The resource you put these 2 lines in is being protected. Now you need to repeat this process to each resource you want to be protected by our Safe Events system.

### But how can I uninstall it?

Simple, just remove the above 2 lines from the resource manifest file and done! Good as new.
